Firstly, a ***heartfelt thank you*** for
making time to contribute to this project! <br />

Our contribution steps in a _nutshell_:
<!-- The text under the magnifying glass says: 
        "validate the need exists"
        "or undesired behavior"
        "from the user's perspective"

      I believe this should be something like
        "validate the need or"
        "undesired behavior exists"
        "from the user's perspective"
      but the image is not in the repo
      so I can't modify it myself.

# Part 1: _Describe_ your Question, the Idea or User Story in an Issue

### _Why_ Use GitHub Issues...?

_Everything_ starts with a _thought_.
We collect _all_ our _thoughts_ in GitHub "issues". <br />
The issue can then be _**discussed, validated**
and **worked on** as a **team**_ while keeping ***everyone informed***. <br />
We use _issues_ to _log_ our user stories, sub/technical tasks
and any ***progress*** towards solving the issue, <br />
this ***ensures*** we have a
[_**single source** of **truth**_](https://github.com/dwyl/github-reference#why)
that _everyone_ can easily see!  


### Step 1: Check if the Question/Idea/Story/Issue _Already Exists_ Using GitHub Search ![search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22224334/255930a8-e1b6-11e6-9953-12cd4739aa1c.png)

1. Please take a moment to ***read through the existing stories/issues***
for the project <br />
to familiarize yourself with the _current_ "***backlog***".
(_There is a chance what you are thinking has **already** been **described**
  by someone else..._)

1. Try ***searching*** through the ***existing issues***
for _keywords_ associated with the story/issue you want to create. <br />
For example, you could use
https://github.com/dwyl/time/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20app+icon
if `"app"` and `"icon"` were the keywords for what you have in mind
and you were searching in the "**Time**" project. <br />
![issue-matching-keyword-search](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22225715/852d9f78-e1bb-11e6-9d20-37492da92dc1.png)

1. If you ***find*** an _existing_ issue that matches what you were looking for,
_please_ click on the title of the issue, ***read the description*** to
confirm that it's what you are looking for, then ***comment*** on it
so we know more than one person has the need/issue. <br />
> _**Note**: If there is **already an issue** for what you were thinking,
you can **skip** steps 2 & 3.
as there's **no need** to create a **duplicate new issue**_.
![issue-search-for-app-icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24758860/22225508/993c7ecc-e1ba-11e6-8a53-e8d2ac398546.png)

1. _Otherwise_, once you are _reasonably_ sure there is
no _existing_ question/issue/story covering what you have in mind,
_please_ **create** a ***new issue*** (_see next step_!)

### Step 2: Create a New User Story _or_ Report an Issue ![New Issue](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22224203/bbc5efb4-e1b5-11e6-9fcb-3aae75ae74ed.png)

1. Using the `New Issue` button, create an **issue**
  for the ***user story***
  (_feature request, expected or **unexpected** behaviour, or question_)
  you have in mind.

> _**Note**: If you are **new** to writing "**User Stories**",
please checkout out our **Example User-focused Story Descriptions**
section in the "Notes" section below_!


### Step 3: Submit the _New Issue_!

1. Submit the new issue!

2. Once you _submit_ a new issue for a User Story or Question/Issue/Bug, a member
of the team (_typically the Product Owner_) will ***review*** the issue.

3. That's _it_ from the side of the _issue_ creator! (_Thank you!_)

# Questions?


### _Why_ Does the Issue _Need_ to be _Validated_? >> One Word: _Communication_

This _may initially feel_ a bit "_bureaucratic_" but
we _urge_ you _not_ to think of it as <br />
["_jumping through hoops_"](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/jump_through_hoops).
_We_ think of ***issue validation*** as something that:

+ ***ensures*** that **everyone** on the project
is ***aware*** of the issue/idea/story.

+ ***saves you time*** by ***avoiding*** ***duplicating effort***!
> The **Project Lead** (**PL**)
has _detailed knowledge_ of the _current_ issue backlog
and all _previous_ ("closed") issues. <br />
They know _how_ features/functionality _should_ work and can
validate things from the _user's_ perspective. <br />
***Most importantly*** the PO/PL ***knows*** if someone ***else***
is ***already*** working on the issue... <br />
And, _sometimes_ the _exact_ same issue has been "***solved before***"
in a _different_ project, so ***hours/days*** of effort can be saved!!


+ ***someone else*** might have **insight** they can share on the issue! <br />
> For example, if you have a **question** or are stuck on a challenge/problem,
[_**share** your **thoughts** and/or **progress**
towards "**solving**" it in **issue comments**_](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-nightwatch/issues/8#issuecomment-264734792)
you _never_ know when you will get _insight_ from a ***complete stranger***!

+ ***capturing information in issues*** _maintains_ ***relevance and focus***.
> The discussion is not "***lost***"
the way it would be in "_chat_"
and discussion are grouped by relevant topic.

+ ***clearly document*** the project so anyone _joining_ the team
_later_ on can see the "_history_".
> We have found this to be _invaluable_ when people are _learning_
why and how something works the way it does!

### How _Long_ Does it take for an Issue to be _Validated_?

We ***aim*** to respond to new issues within _**minutes**_
but during busy work days this can take up to ***a few hours***... <br />
(_**Thank you** for your **patience**!
  **Please** help us by giving as much useful information
  as possible in the issue description._)
<br />

### What can I do `while` I _wait_ for a my issue to be _validated_?

+ If you are ***itching*** to help "move the issue/story along"
you can help by _describing_ how the story/issue _could_
be implemented or "_fixed_" ... feel free to ***describe your thoughts***
in a **_follow-up_ comment** on the issue you _just_ created!

+ **_Please_ do not write _any_ code _until_**
the story/issue/bug has been ***verified***
(_by the product owner or project lead_). <br />
(_It's not that we "doubt" anyone's abilities or the validity of ideas/issues
we simply don't want people "wasting time" or "duplicating effort"
on un-verified issues...
also there are **many** other ways you can help `while` you wait..._)

# Part 2: _Validate_ the Need (User Story) or Issue _Exists_

> A _different_ team member from the person who _created_ the issue
***must validate*** the User Story/Issue.

### _Confirm_ the Need in the New Story/Issue

1. When a new issue (_user story, feature request or potential bug_)
is submitted by someone, we _require_ a _different_ person to verify it. <br />
_Typically_ this verification of need
is done by the "_Product Owner_" ("**PO**")
or the "_Project Leader_" ("**PL**"),
but in the case that the issue was _created_ by the PO/PL then a _different_
member of the team will need to _confirm_ their _understanding_ of the issue.

1. The person acknowledging the user story will add some **labels** to
the issue to help ***categorise*** it. eg. `question`, `discuss`, etc.

1. (_More_) Labels can always be added/removed at any time. The purpose of
labels is to help the team categorize and prioritize issues in the backlog see:
[complete list of labels](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/labels)

<br /><br />

# Part 3: _Do_ the _Work_!

Once _all_ the previous steps have been performed
(_story/issue created, categorized with labels, any sub-stories/tasks
  created_)
and you are _sure_ you ***understand*** what is ***required***
(_make sure there are clear Acceptance Criteria_), add a comment on how you
propose to resolve/implement your resolution to the issue and
go for it!

### Step 1: _Estimate_ the Time Required to Perform the Work

1. For an _ongoing_ project the time estimate **_must_ factor** time to:
  + ***document*** the changes made to the codebase or UI
  + ***test*** both the code (_unit/functional tests_) and UI tests
  + ***develop*** the feature (_or fix the "bug"_)
  + ***deliver*** by submitting a PR and going through a review/QA cycle.
  + ***deploy*** the work to an environment
  where a non-technical peopler can _evaluate_ it against the original
  story description and acceptance criteria!

+ Wherever possible/practical/relevant **include** the person who
  **_originally_ created the story/issue** in the time estimation discussion.

### Step 2: _Assign_ Yourself the Task and [_Do it_]

1. ***Assign*** the story/issue to yourself _before_ you start working.

2. ***Apply*** the `in-progress` **label** to the story/issue/sub-task so
  that your team knows when the work was started
  and that it is ***currently*** being worked.

3. ***Update*** the `README.md` ***before*** working on the task:
  _Ensuring_ you answer the questions: ***Why? What? How?***
  (_If this feels "tedious" to you, 
  remind yourself of the last time you
  "**inherited**" **undocumented code**..._) <br />
  **Watch**: ["**_The Mess_ We're In**" by Joe Armstrong](https://youtu.be/lKXe3HUG2l4?t=8m56s)

4. ***Reference*** the **user story/issue/sub-task** you are working on
  by pasting a link to the GitHub issue
  in the **commit message**.

5. Once you have _committed_ your work/progress, push up your changes
  and then open a Pull Request _(even if the work isn't yet finished)_ <br />
  so that the rest of your team can easily see what you've been working on.
  (_Remember ..._)
  + Add `[WiP]` before the title of your PR and add that it's
  **NOT READY FOR REVIEW** in the description if it's still in progress.

### Step 3: _Prepare_ a Pull Request (PR) and _Assign_ (_to someone else_) for Review

1. ***Describe*** what your PR contains in the PR description;
it only takes a _few seconds_
but ***dramatically improves*** the ***review process***. <br />
(_Please **never** leave the PR description blank!
  remember this is in an exercise in **communicating with your team members**_!)

+ Make sure ***all tests*** are **passing**
  and (_where applicable_) that your **code coverage** is ***100%***.
  + ***Never*** _assign_ a PR for "_review_"
  _until_ _**all CI checks** have **passed**_.
  ![check failed](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22284176/db2d698a-e2dd-11e6-8799-573226328b6b.png) <br />
  if _anything_ is failing on a PR and you _need_ help simply
  ***comment*** in the PR "_thread_" _asking_ for help!

+ Make sure your PR **adds to the `README`** to explain the latest changes made
(or explain specifically **why** you _haven't_ had to update the `README`).

+ ***Assign*** someone `else` to _review_ your PR. <br />
(_Please don't merge your own PRs. We need to ensure every change
has been reviewed by at least one other person on the team. Thanks!_)

### Step 4: _Reviewer(s): Review_, _Comment On_ and _Merge_ the Pull Request

Always remember: a **Pull Requests** is a
"_**discussion thread** for **understanding** the code_".
Our objective is to _ensure_ the code works, is well documented/tested
and is "_free from errors_". We don't
["_nit pick_"](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/nitpicking)
if it's going to delay shipping. Equally, where code requires _clarification_,
tell people. ***Everyone*** benefits from _easy-to-read_ (easy-to-understand) code.

The person who is _assigned_ to review the PR
(_often referred to as the **Quality Assurance Person** or "**QA**", maybe Project Lead because there is no QA in this project_) will:

<!-- should we be re-confirming that CI Checks pass before reviewing?
or should we *rely* on the PR submitter to have done the checks?
see: https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/pull/63#discussion_r97884381
1. ***Confirm*** that all "**CI**" ***checks pass*** _before_ doing anything else.
> Tests should all pass and "_test coverage_" should be _measured_
for every change/pull request. <br />
All our projects aim for 100% Test Coverage.
The project should also have a
[pre-commit hook](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-pre-commit) <br />
to check that the code has been "linted" and conforms to standard.
-->

1. ***Apply*** the
[`in-review` **label**](https://github.com/dwyl/labels/issues/48)
to the Pull Request to signal to other members of the team that the PR
is being reviewed. (_At this point, new commits which change large portions
  of the code being reviewed should not be pushed unless
  they are for changes that have been requested by the reviewer_)

1. ***Checkout*** the PR's _branch_ and run it on your local machine
following the instructions in the `README.md` file, where applicable.
> ***Confirm*** the tests pass and the app runs on your local machine.

1. ***Open the Issue(s)*** referenced in the Pull Request
and re-acquaint yourself with the User Stories so you can
***confirm*** the content of the PR **satisfies** the ***Acceptance Criteria***.

1. ***Review*** the _content_ (_documentation, tests, or code_)
in the Pull Request on GitHub...

1. ***Write comments*** or notes to the developer(s)
giving feedback on their code.
> See: "notes on code reviews": https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues/32#issuecomment-271089111 [![Get Help!](https://img.shields.io/badge/help-wanted-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dwyl/contributing/issues)

  + ***If***, for _any reason_, you are ***unsatisfied*** with the _content_ of the
pull request (_documentation, tests or code_), ***request changes***.
  + ***Don't be afraid*** to "_push back_" on a PR if the code is unclear,
***especially*** if the developer who's code you are reviewing is
"_more experienced_", because they _might_ be making _assumptions_ that
their code is "_self-documenting_"... <br />

+ Once you are _satisfied_ that the content in the Pull Request is acceptable,
approve the pull request using GitHub's "_Review_" interface. <br />
![review-changes-submit](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22298017/f45fa20e-e316-11e6-8fd6-d9825f5ce682.png) <br />
> We ***encourage peer-review*** by team-members on ***all*** our projects, <br />
so it's not _uncommon_ to see _multiple_ people "***approving***" a PR. <br />
e.g: https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/collectionsonline/pull/708 <br />
![multiple-reviewers](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/22298408/54d24b7c-e318-11e6-9009-4b42bba4f5e4.png)

1. ***Merge the Pull Request***.

1. ***Delete The Branch*** on GitHub (_and your local machine_).
The code is now merged into another branch (_most likely `master`_)
so deleting the branch will not "_lose_" any code.

1. ***Finally***, _someone_ on the team
(_usually the developer who created the PR_)
applies the [`please-test` **label**]
to any issues mentioned in the PR so that the Product Owner and/or
User Testing Team are _aware_ that the feature is ready to test.

2. ***Ideally*** the ***Original Issue Creator*** should post a comment
confirming that the issue (User Story, Question or Problem) has been
adequately addressed and then ***close the issue***.
> In ***practice*** the PO often ends up closing the issue.

<br /><br />

# Notes on _Effective_ Contributing


## _Example_ User-focused "Story" Descriptions

_**User stories** describe features_ (_or "**expected behaviour**")
of the application_ <br />
in terms of the ***value***
(_or "**benefit**"_) to the ***person using the application***.

  Example user story (_if the feature has not been described before_):
  ```
  As a person using the Web App
  I want to be able to save a shortcut app icon to my home screen
  so that I can easily get back into the app without having to navigate to it.
  ```
  
  Or, when you are reporting an issue/bug/fault, try and include
  the exact steps to "_reproduce_" the issue. <br />
  Example:
  ```
  when using the app on an iPhone 6 running the latest OS (10.2)
  when I attempt to save a shortcut to my home screen,
  I do not see an app icon. :-(
  ```
### Include Any/All _Relevant_ Information in the _Issue Description_

+ Please *include* as much ***relevant information*** as you can
so the Product Owner (_or project leader_)
can ***validate*** that
it is a **necessary/desired** feature.

+ **Note**: A _good_ user story _describes_ the idea
  in a _**concise** and **user-focused**_ way. <br />

+ ***Never*** leave the issue _description_ blank
even when you are in a "rush". <br />
The point of issues is to _communicate_.
If you see an _incomplete_ issue flag it.
(_Link your friend to here...!_)<br />
You _wouldn't_ send a _blank email_
to hundreds of your friends (_unless you wanted to freak them out!_), yet,<br />
submitting ***blank issues*** is doing _exactly_ that!
It sends a ["_I have **no idea** what I'm doing_"](https://www.google.com/search?q=i+have+no+idea+what+i%27m+doing&tbm=isch)
**message** to your ***peers*** ... <br />
Which was only _amusing_ the _first_ time ... _just_ ***communicate better***.


Example of useful details:
```
People using the app will only access the app from their company-issued
Android (Lollipop) Mobile phone (5 inch Samsung Galaxy J).
The screen resolution is 1080 x 1920 pixels.
```
Or, when describing a specific need for "_offline capability_":
```
People use the app in areas with poor mobile signal,
so the app has to work offline and sync data/changes later
when they are back on WiFi or 3G.
```
Or, when reporting an issue (_potential bug_):
```
People using Windows 8 and Internet Explorer 10 report that
they cannot click on the button to save their app preferences/settings.
```

> ***Tip***: _If you **can upload** a_ ***sketch*** (_of the idea_) or
***screenshot*** (_of the issue_), it helps _clarify_ things a lot! <br />
> ***How to take screenshot***: https://www.take-a-screenshot.org
(_all platforms_!)

Example creating a **New Issue** for an ***expected behaviour***
with a ***clear description*** and **_illustrative_ screenshots**:

[![create-issue-for-home-screen-icon](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/24758860/22227322/ae12d9f6-e1c2-11e6-928c-c20cfe8b3912.png)](https://github.com/dwyl/dwyl.github.io/issues/194)

<br /><br />

## _Notes_ on Creating _Good_ Pull Requests

### 1. Keep It Small and Simple (AKA the KISS principle)

+ Don't be _tempted_, to "_bundle_" up _several_ bug fixes/feature additions into
one _large_ PR and then submit it to be reviewed all at once... <br />
We prefer working in _smaller increments_ splitting the work
into individual parts to be reviewed separately. <br />
> _Why_...? Read: "***Work in Small Batches***": <br /> https://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/02/work-in-small-batches.html

+ The _best_ PRs **update the documentation** (often the repo's README file)

+ ***Always*** _ensure_ there are **passing tests** for any new code you have written.

### 2. _Descriptive_ Pull Request Title and Description!

+ A **descriptive title** answers the question:
"_What is **included** in this PR_?"

+ A ***good description*** summaries the _contents_ of the PR and
gives the person/people reviewing the PR
a **clear picture/focus** for the feature/change/bug-fix
which ***improves review speed***.

+ ***Reference*** the issue(s) that the PR addressed in the PR description.

### 3. PR _Etiquette_

+ Explain what the PR includes (**bullet pointed lists**
  are sometimes helpful to make things clearer)
  and the _implementation detail_.

+ If you have the _permissions_ to do so,
**assign your pull request**
to someone (_else_) for review.

+ ***Never*** merge your _own_ pull requests on a **_team_ project**.
**No Exceptions**. Just ***don't do it***.

A good example PR: https://github.com/indexzero/ps-tree/pull/12
created from the ***need***
which was ***validated*** and ***discussed*** in
an **issue** https://github.com/indexzero/ps-tree/issues/10
***before*** _any_ work was performed.
